The Beduino Pro Mini is a prototyping board based on the NXP MKW41Z SoC:

* ARM Cortex-M0+ CPU
* 64/128 KB RAM
* 256/512 KB flash
* 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting Bluetooth Low Energy and IEEE 802.15.4
* AES-128 Hardware Accelerator
* True Random Number Generator

In addition to the SoC, the board features the following:

* 2.4 GHz trace antenna
* LDO voltage regulator for 5V supply
* The necessary oscillators and passive components
* Two LEDs (red and green)
* Reset button

The board layout also includes a DIPDAP programmer, which can be
detached from the Beduino Pro Mini (using a fine saw or a dremel tool)
and later reconnected using the usual seven-pin DIPDAP header.
The programmer features the following:

* USB connection
* Flashing and debugging of the MKW41Z using SWD
* Fully supported in OpenOCD
* USB-to-Serial adapter
* Powering of Beduino Pro Mini over USB
